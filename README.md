# Ramadan-Quiz
Welcome to the Github repository for an exciting multiplayer quiz game called "Ramadan Quiz Game"! 
This indie game has been created by Ahmad Alrifai using Unity and Playfab. The game is centered around questions related to Ramadan, which makes it not only enjoyable but educational as well.

The multiplayer aspect of the game allows players to compete against each other in real-time, making it a fun way to challenge friends and family. The game has been designed to provide a seamless experience with easy-to-use controls and an engaging interface.

This repository contains all the necessary files and code for the game, including the Unity project, Playfab integration, and the quiz questions related to Ramadan. Feel free to explore the code, make changes, and contribute to the project to make it even better.
